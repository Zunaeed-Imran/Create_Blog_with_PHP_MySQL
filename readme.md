## PHP Blog Project Using LocalHost Server
- we practice a blog post
- we take two value `title` and `content` 
- for button we use  input 
- and write all the php code in connect page. 

2.2_practice.php (some of my fault)
- i forgot to name in button
- i forgot to rename the text input

3.1_practice (some of my fault)
- this time i forget to write form 
- i write input without form.
- without form element input php  will not work in html page

3.2_practice (some of my fault)
- i was giving '=' after $row variable and that was a mistake
- in foreach value we done't have to use '=' after variable

3.3_practice.php (some of my dault)
- it is delete key page
- i forgot to set delete id set in index page
